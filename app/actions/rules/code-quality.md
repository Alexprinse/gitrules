## Code Quality

- Remove dead code immediately rather than maintaining it - no backward compatibility or legacy functions
- Prioritize functionality over production-ready patterns
- Focus on user experience and feature completeness
- When updating code, don't reference what is changing (avoid keywords like LEGACY, CHANGED, REMOVED), instead focus on comments that document just the functionality of the code
- Always keep code SUPER minimal, never introduce features not explicitly mentioned.
